      <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
      <p>Hey you. Great job back on earth. Things are all good. Oh, and there's aliens now.</p>
      <p>Yes, pilot. We have known about the aliens for quite some time. Check your handbook, section 24A.</p>
      <p>*Pulls off face mask. Reveals I've been an alien this WHOLE TIME*</p>
      <p>Pilot, we've had some good time out there. 
          I remember when you first came into trainging, wet around your ear. Alien, human, cyborg, I don't care. 
          We've had some good times. 
          Which is why I'm so sorry to say this but... that ship you're on is not built for a return journey. 
          In a bout 35 seconds, thrusters will engage and put you directly on course to fall into the sun. 
        Godspeed.</p>
